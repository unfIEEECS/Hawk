*	Stage 2 = 290 pts
*	Stage 4 = 210 pts

# Req for Start
1.	Hardware and Electrical Drivetrain complete (It Can Move)

**Points**
*	Move (10 pts)
*	Drive out of Starting Zone (30 pts)

## Approach
((just use a voltage sensor(voltage))If you use the charging and discharge rate,then you can classify using regression comparision)

# Req for Stage 2
1. Must use a magnetic sensor
2. Hit pole when magnet for 4 times (1/2 period to comply to on)
3. Will lose points for each incorret hit (-50 pts -> max 200 pts) 1/2 sec grace period

**Points** (290 pts)
*	touch a part in stage 2(10 pts)
*	hit pole to start battle (30 pts)
*	hit pole while on (250)
	*	1 hit (65 pts)
	*	2 hit (110 pts)
	*	3 hit (170 pts)
	*	4 hit (250 pts)
*	hit while pole off(**-50 pts**)

# Req for Stage 4
1. Can shoot from anywhere on the field
2. Sounds like you only get 3 shots at a time

**Points** (210 pts)
*	Fire a nerf dart (10pts)
*	Shoot Darts into Target Zone (200 pts)
	*	1 Dart(50 pts)
	*	2 Dart(120 pts)
	*	3 Dart(200 pts)
